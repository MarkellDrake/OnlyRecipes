# OnlyRecipes
OnlyRecipes

## Description
The purpose of this website is to allow people to look up recipes without having to scroll through all of the extra stories and blogs people tend to add before sharing their recipes. People can create profiles in which they can have a bio and list recipes they uploaded. Recipes that are uploaded will have a comment section. 

## Technologies Used
This project uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. Handlebars.js is used for the templating engine. The database is made using MySQL and Sequelize ORM. GET and POST routes are used for retrieving and adding new recipes/data. It was deployed using Heroku. This project required the use of a new package that we as a group have never used before. We chose to use Nodemon. Bulma was used for the CSS framework. Express-session and cookies were included as authentication.
